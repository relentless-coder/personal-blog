I have always enjoyed bloggin. It wouldn't be an understatement if I said that it was blogging that paved the path for me to become a software developer. I started my first blog on [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/?rinli=1).

I used to write about my teenage life. Although, it didn't contain the most grammatically correct content, it was fun. Then I started another blog with the hopes of becoming a life coach.

Then I left college, and I didn't know what else to do. So this time, with my ass on the line, and I stuck through the learning porcess. And voila! 1.5 years into it, I am living my teenage dream to listen to music on vinyl.
