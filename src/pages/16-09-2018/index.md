So, for a long time now, I've been losing my mind over a simple question.

> If I die right now, would I be okay with it?

And my answer has always been, **No!**

I look at my dreams, and my desires in the new light, I get extremely sad. I get overpowered by abject hopelessnes.

It was getting hard for me to look myself in the mirror, knowing that if I died in the next moment, I wouldn't be happy with where I am.

I tried to reach to a conclusion that I can be content with for the time being. Here's what I have:

I am comparing myself to a future version of me. The version that I want to be, the version that I might never become.

I think a better question to ask myself would be, am I at the place where I wanted to be 3 years ago? The answer to that would be, **Hell, yeah!!**

3 years ago, I didn't want to continue with my formal education. Check.

3 years ago, I wanted to earn a good living without having a college degree. Although, I failed at the first few attempts, but around 1.5 years ago, I achieved that as well. Check.

3 years ago, I wanted to get a few health problems fixed. Although, a few of those still remain, at least one of those is solved. Check.

I can compare the situation with when I was in school. I wasn't as anxious, I wasn't as confused. The goals were clear, and the proof of everything working out for good was all around me. I had to do well in a couple of exams, and I'd progress in life.

The moment I moved on to a different track, I lost the sense of certainty, the goals are still clear, but with no clear checkpoints in sight, or even a sign of a checkpoint up ahead, it only makes me anxious about everything that I do. 

As if, I just realised that I am mortal, and the next step that I take could end my life. And I'd die in the process of finding out whether or not the step that I took brings me closer to my goal.

I don't know what to do about it, but as long as I am where I wanted to be few years ago, I should be fine.
